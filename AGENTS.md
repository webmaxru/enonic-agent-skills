This repository contains a small working set of agent skills and support assets that follow the agentskills.io style: lean `SKILL.md` files, progressive disclosure through `references/` and `assets/`, and deterministic helper scripts where guessing would be brittle.

Repository layout:

- `skills/*` primary repository content: each subfolder is a standalone skill with its own `SKILL.md`, `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`.
- `.github/skills/` is the local supporting skills used to create, update, validate, and review skills in this repository.
- `assets/` is for internal supporting materials only. Do not treat it as user-facing repository content and do not consider it for README updates.
- `artifacts/*` might contain disposable demos for testing skills. Never use this folder for any persistent asset, because it is ignored by Git and may be deleted without warning.
- `.github/prompts/` contains maintenance prompts for validating skills, remediating skill issues, updating the Prompt API skill, and recreating the demo artifact.

When working in this repo:

1. Treat skills as agent-facing control files, not human documentation bundles.
2. In README sections named `Included Skills`, list only skills that exist under `/skills/`.
3. Keep each skill directory flat under `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`.
4. Match the skill folder name and the YAML `name` field exactly.
5. Keep `SKILL.md` lean and procedural; move bulky rules, examples, and templates into `references/` or `assets/`.
6. Use relative paths with forward slashes in skill files.
7. Do not add per-skill human-oriented files such as `README.md` or `CHANGELOG.md`.
8. When creating or revising a skill, use `.agents/skills/skill-creator/scripts/validate-metadata.py` and `.agents/skills/skill-creator/references/checklist.md` as the repository's validation path.
9. For saved maintenance prompts that gather external information, request sources in this priority order unless the prompt explicitly says otherwise: supplied prompt text, supplied attached documents, then the built-in URLs already defined in the prompt. Higher-priority sources override lower-priority sources.
10. Never consider contents of `artifacts/` as persistent or canonical. Never add description of it to the README or reference it from any skill. Always treat it as a scratch space that can be deleted without warning.
